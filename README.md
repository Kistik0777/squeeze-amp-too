# SqueezeAmpToo: an all-in-one audio sub-system

The SqueezeAmpT0o is designed by Dave Viberg and Chuck Rohs and was completely inspired by the [SqueezeAMP project](https://github.com/philippe44/SqueezeAMP) and the [SqueezeESP project](https://github.com/philippe44/squeezelite-esp32).

This design was prototyped using the Squeezelite-code on a WRover board used on an unrelated project (the punch sensor) and fly wired to clone of the HiFiBerry AMP+, which is based off of the TAS5713 chip.  As such a TAS driver needed to be written for the squeezelite-esp32 code for prototyping. That is now all ancient history but the picture is here for posterity (covered in CMC router dust):
